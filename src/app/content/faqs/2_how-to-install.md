question: How do I install an add on?
---

You should be able to point your AI Agent of choice to the add-on's README and it will handle the rest. For example, here's a prompt you might use.

```
Please apply this addon to my RedwoodSDK project using these instructions: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redwoodjs/passkey-addon/refs/heads/main/README.md
```

In this case, `passkey-addon` is the name of the add-on's repo. Obviously, this would change depending on what add-on you're trying to install.
