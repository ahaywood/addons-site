question: What's the licensing for add ons?
---
Add Ons are provided under a commercial license that allows you to use them in any number of personal or commercial projects. Once installed, the code becomes part of your project and you can modify it freely. However, you cannot redistribute add ons as standalone products or resell them to other developers.
