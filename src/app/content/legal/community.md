# Community Guidelines

We’re building a space where developers can collaborate, share tools, and grow the ecosystem together. To keep this community helpful, respectful, and productive, please follow these guidelines:

## 1. Be Respectful

Treat everyone with kindness and professionalism. Disagreement is okay—disrespect is not.

## 2. Keep It Relevant

Contribute content and comments that are related to RedwoodSDK, development tools, and add-on usage. Avoid off-topic promotion or unrelated discussions.

## 3. No Hate or Harassment

We have zero tolerance for any form of discrimination, harassment, or hate speech. That includes content based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, or any personal characteristic.

## 4. Use Clear and Constructive Language

When offering feedback—especially on someone else’s work—aim to be helpful, specific, and encouraging.

## 5. Give Credit Where It’s Due

Only publish code, assets, or ideas you have the right to share. Attribute original authors when appropriate.

## 6. No Spam or Self-Promotion

This isn’t the place for marketing blasts. You’re welcome to promote your own add-ons—but keep it useful, relevant, and transparent.

## 7. Report Issues Responsibly

If you encounter a problem with an add-on, use the appropriate feedback channels. Be specific and respectful—remember, we’re all trying to improve together.

## 8. Follow the Licensing Rules

Respect the licenses attached to any add-ons or code snippets you use or contribute.

## 9. Help New Developers

This ecosystem thrives when experienced developers support newcomers. If you’re answering questions or reviewing submissions, be patient and encouraging.

## 10. Represent the Project Well

You are part of the public face of RedwoodSDK. Let’s build a community others want to join.
